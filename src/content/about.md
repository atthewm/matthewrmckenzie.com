# About

Matthew operates at the intersection of capital formation, growth strategy, and real asset backed consumer platforms. He structures capital and investor partnerships that support disciplined growth and long-term ownership.

He has experience working with family offices, UHNW investors, and institutional groups globally across both debt and equity. His background spans real estate, operating businesses, and platform development, with an emphasis on thoughtful underwriting and durable business models.

Outside of work, Matthew is an investor and mentor. He is a hybrid athlete focused on health and performance, and he enjoys cooking and sourdough baking, photography and videography, travel, and spending time outdoors.

## Now

What I am working on and thinking about right now:

- A small daily-use product in the prayer and wellness space
- Health and performance tooling and personal tracking systems
- Data-driven projects in a regulated domain
- An early-stage community concept involving dogs and local gathering
