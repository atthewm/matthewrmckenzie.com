# About

I'm Matthew McKenzie. I build things at the intersection of technology, design, and human experience.

## Background

I've spent my career working across startups and technology companies, shipping products that people actually use. I care deeply about craft -- the details that make software feel alive. This site is a reflection of that: a personal OS built from scratch as a love letter to the Mac OS X era that shaped how I think about interfaces.

## What I Do

I'm a product builder. I work across the full stack -- from design systems and front-end architecture to backend infrastructure and deployment. I'm particularly drawn to projects where technology meets creativity.

## Interests

Design, architecture, music production, fitness, cooking, and the endless pursuit of the perfect sourdough loaf. I track my health obsessively with WHOOP and believe that how you take care of your body directly impacts the quality of your work.

## This Site

matthewrmckenzie.com is a Next.js 15 app styled after Mac OS X 10.3 Panther. Every window, menu, and animation is hand-built. The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/atthewm/matthewrmckenzie.com).
