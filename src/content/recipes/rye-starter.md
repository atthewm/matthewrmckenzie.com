## Overview
Rye starter build and upkeep using whole rye flour and warm water.

## Yield
Makes about 175 g starter

## Equipment
- Jar or plastic container with lid
- Flexible plastic dough scraper
- Digital thermometer
- Bowl or other vessel for a warm water bath

## Ingredients
- Whole rye flour
- Warm water (82°F / 28°C)

## Temperature targets
- Try to keep the starter at or above 77°F / 25°C.
- When warming, do not exceed 131°F / 55°C (higher risks damaging the culture).

## Day-by-day build

### Day 1
- Mix 50 g rye flour + 50 g warm water (82°F / 28°C) until uniform.
- Cover and rest 24 hours. If it is cool, set the container in a warm water bath to bring it up gently.

### Day 2
- If liquid has separated on top, stir it back in.
- Stir briefly to add oxygen.
- Cover and rest 24 hours (keep warm as needed).

### Day 3
- Feed: add 25 g rye flour + 25 g warm water and mix well.
- Cover and rest 24 hours.

### Day 4
- Discard half.
- Feed: add 50 g rye flour + 50 g warm water and mix well.
- Cover and rest 24 hours.
- If there is still no sign of fermentation after keeping it warm and refreshing it, restart with fresh flour. If you see mold or colored streaks, discard and restart.

### Day 5
- Discard half.
- Feed: add 50 g rye flour + 50 g warm water.
- Cover and rest 24 hours.

### Day 6
- Discard half.
- Feed: add 50 g rye flour + 50 g warm water.
- Cover and rest 24 hours.

## How to tell it is healthy
A healthy starter shows bubbles and a steady rise over a few hours after feeding, then it falls back down.

## Daily maintenance
- Discard about 90% of your starter.
- Feed with equal parts flour and water by weight.
- For rye starter, feed once per day.

### Low-waste option (when you are not baking)
- Keep about 100 g starter on hand.
- Each day: discard down to 10 g starter, then feed 45 g flour + 45 g water.
- For rye starter, do this once per day.

## Planning ahead (when you need more starter)
If you need 250 g starter that has been fed about 12 hours earlier:
- Discard down to 10 g starter.
- Feed 125 g flour + 125 g water.
This yields enough starter for a bake and leaves a little to carry forward.

## Missed feedings or fridge time
If you miss a feeding or the starter has been in the fridge for a few days, bring it back to room temperature and give it a few days of regular feedings before baking.

## Macros
Yeah, don't eat it
