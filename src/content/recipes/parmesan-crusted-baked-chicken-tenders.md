A higher-protein, lower-butter version of classic baked Parmesan chicken using tenders.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb chicken tenders (about 20 tenders)
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 4 tbsp butter, melted (most will remain in pan; assume ~1 tbsp absorbed)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet or baking dish.
2. In a shallow bowl, combine Parmesan, bread crumbs, paprika, garlic salt, and pepper.
3. Dip each chicken tender lightly into melted butter.
4. Roll tenders in the Parmesan mixture, pressing lightly so coating adheres.
5. Arrange tenders on the pan without touching.
6. Bake uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes, or until internal temp reaches 165°F and coating is golden.
7. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
