# Welcome

Hey, I'm Matthew McKenzie. This is my personal corner of the internet.

Navigate around like you would a desktop: double-click folders and apps to explore, drag windows around, and make yourself at home.

Head to [About](/about) for background or [Work](/work) for the professional side.

## Colophon

This site is built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The desktop metaphor is a custom UI built from scratch with React, TypeScript, and CSS.
