# Welcome

Hey - I'm Matthew McKenzie. This is my personal corner of the internet.

Navigate around like you would a desktop: double-click folders and apps to explore, drag windows around, and make yourself at home.

## What's here

- **About** - A bit about who I am and what I care about.
- **Work** - Selected projects, case studies, and my resume.
- **Writing** - Essays and longer-form thinking.
- **Photos** - Visual work and photography.
- **Contact** - Ways to get in touch.

## Colophon

This site is built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The desktop metaphor is a custom UI - no iframes, no OS emulators. Just React, TypeScript, and a lot of CSS.
