# Homemade Tortillas

Soft, warm flour tortillas. Once you make them fresh, you never go back.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 0.75 tsp baking powder
- 3 tbsp lard or vegetable shortening
- 0.75 cup warm water

## Directions

1. Mix flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl.
2. Cut in lard with fingers or a pastry cutter until crumbly.
3. Add warm water gradually, mixing until a soft dough forms.
4. Knead on a floured surface for 2 minutes until smooth.
5. Divide into 8-10 balls. Cover and rest 15 minutes.
6. Roll each ball thin on a floured surface.
7. Cook on a hot, dry skillet 30-45 seconds per side until lightly blistered.
8. Stack in a towel-lined basket to keep warm and soft.

*The secret is a screaming hot pan and not rolling them too thick.*
