## Ingredients (locked)

- Promix Grass-Fed Whey (Cinnamon Swirl): 1 serving
- Milk (fat-free or 2%): 1/3 cup

- Cinnamon: to taste (freshly ground organic Ceylon)

## Steps
1. Add oats, whey, hemp hearts, and cinnamon to a jar or bowl.
2. Add milk and water. Stir until fully combined and no dry pockets remain.
3. Cover and refrigerate 6 to 12 hours.

## Notes
- Thicker texture comes from the revised liquid ratio and a full overnight rest.
- If using 2% milk instead of fat-free, macros may change.
