A lean, high-protein upgrade to the original with grass-fed beef, pasture-raised lamb, venison, and half the breadcrumbs for better macros and bold flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb organic grass-fed ground beef (93/7)
- 1 lb pasture-raised ground lamb (Atkins Ranch)
- 1 lb pasture-raised ground venison (First Light Farms, 96/4)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
- 1 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- Optional: small splash of milk if mixture feels dry
- Olive oil for hands when rolling

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. In a large bowl, combine beef, lamb, and venison.
3. Add eggs, Parmesan, parsley, garlic, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
4. Add 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and mix gently until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Lightly oil hands and form into 12 evenly sized meatballs.
6. Place on a baking sheet sprayed with oil. Do not let them touch.
7. Bake 10 minutes on the top rack, then 10 minutes on the bottom rack, or until internal temp reaches 160°F.
8. Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving. Excess fat will render and drain during baking.
