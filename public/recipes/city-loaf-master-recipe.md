## Overview
A two-loaf sourdough formula with a fed starter, autolyse, two folds, warm bulk fermentation, then shaping and an optional overnight cold retard before baking in a Dutch oven.

## Yield
Makes two 950 g loaves

## Timing
### Day 1 (morning)
Feed starter, autolyse and mix dough, bulk ferment, preshape, final shape.
Total about 8 hours (most of it is bulk and proof), plus an optional overnight cold retard up to 12 hours.

### Day 2 (morning)
Preheat oven, transfer dough to Dutch oven, score, and bake.
Total about 2.5 to 3 hours (including preheat).

## Equipment
- Medium and large mixing bowls
- Digital thermometer
- Flexible plastic dough scraper
- Bowl or pitcher of warm water (for rinsing)
- Two tea towels
- Bench scraper
- Two bannetons (proofing baskets)
- Cast-iron or enameled Dutch oven with a flat, handleless lid
- Lame or scissors
- Cooling rack

## Starter (build this first)
Mix to create 250 g freshly fed starter. The dough uses 200 g, and you hold back 50 g.

- 104 g hot water (104°F / 40°C)
- 104 g whole wheat flour
- 42 g 12-hour wheat or rye starter

## Dough ingredients
- 500 g bread flour
- 500 g all-purpose flour
- 750 g hot water (104°F / 40°C), added in stages
- 200 g freshly fed starter (from above)
- 25 g salt

## Additional ingredients
- A handful each of all-purpose flour and rice flour (for coating baskets and dusting loaf tops)

## Day 1 steps

### 1) Feed the starter (start the clock)
- In a medium bowl, combine the hot water, whole wheat flour, and 12-hour starter by hand until well mixed.
- Cover and keep warm.
- Set a timer for 45 minutes.
- Check starter temperature and aim for about 86 to 95°F (30 to 35°C). Use a warm or cool water bath around the bowl if you need to nudge the temperature.

### 2) Autolyse
- In a large bowl, combine bread flour + all-purpose flour with 650 g of the hot water.
- Mix by hand until there is no dry flour remaining.
- Cover and rest at least 20 minutes, up to 45 minutes.

### 3) Mix the dough
- Add 200 g of the freshly fed starter to the autolysed dough. Reserve the remaining 50 g starter.
- Add 50 g of the remaining water and work it in until absorbed.
- Add the salt and the final 50 g hot water, mixing until the water is absorbed and the salt is fully incorporated.
- Check dough temperature. In a cooler climate it can be around 88°F / 31°C. In a hot climate it can be around 80°F / 27°C. Aim to keep it consistent through bulk by checking periodically and adjusting with warm or cool water baths if needed.

### 4) Bulk ferment, fold 1
- Cover and rest 45 minutes.
- Fold in the bowl: gently pull dough up and fold it over itself, rotating the bowl a quarter turn between folds. Stop after 4 to 5 folds when the dough tightens and resists further folding.
- Cover and rest 45 minutes.

### 5) Fold 2, then finish bulk
- Repeat the fold sequence.
- Cover and let it continue bulk fermenting for 2.5 hours.
By the end, you should see more and larger bubbles under the surface and a less moist surface.

### 6) Divide and preshape
- Total bulk time is about 4 hours. If the dough seems under-fermented, extend 30 to 60 minutes.
- Divide into two pieces.
- With wet hands and a bench scraper, work each piece into a neat round with surface tension.
- Rest uncovered 45 minutes to 1 hour.

### 7) Final shape and basket
- Dust bannetons with a mix of all-purpose flour and rice flour.
- Lightly dust the tops of the loaves.
- Shape each loaf into an oval and place into the banneton. If the seam opens, gently pinch it closed.
- Cover baskets loosely with a towel.

### 8) Cold retard (optional but recommended)
- Lightly flour the loaves again (use the flour blend so the towel does not stick).
- Refrigerate overnight, up to 12 hours (at most 15 hours).
If you do not have a cool spot, you can leave them on the counter about 2 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator.

## Day 2 baking steps

### 1) Preheat
- Preheat the oven to 500°F / 260°C for at least 1 hour with the Dutch oven inside so it gets fully hot.

### 2) Load and score
- Remove one chilled loaf from the fridge.
- Gently loosen the edges and flip the dough onto the hot lid.
- Score the top using a lame or scissors.
- Invert the Dutch oven pot over the dough to cover it like a dome.

### 3) Bake
- Return to oven, reduce temperature to 450°F / 230°C.
- Bake 20 minutes covered.
- Remove the cover and bake 20 minutes uncovered.
- Cool on a rack at least 1 hour before slicing.

### 4) Second loaf
- Repeat with the second loaf. Keep the Dutch oven hot between loaves.

Assumptions used for macros
- 2 loaves × 950 g baked weight = 1,900 g total.
- 15 slices per loaf = 30 slices total, so 1 slice ≈ 63.3 g.
- Starter assumed 100% hydration, so the 200 g starter contributes ~100 g flour + ~100 g water.
